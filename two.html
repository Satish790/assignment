            <h1>Comments</h1>
            <p>When the code is compiled/rendered by the browser, the browser ignores the HTML comments. Then, why should one write comments in HTML? So if you are working on a big project that includes complex code, you may easily lose track of and purpose of the code you write. In addition to that, if you are working with the team, other developers may not understand your code, and in that instance, the comments come in handy and play a vital role in understanding the piece of code. The comments in the HTML document are enclosed within special brackets and are not displayed on the webpage, but they will appear in our source code.</p>
